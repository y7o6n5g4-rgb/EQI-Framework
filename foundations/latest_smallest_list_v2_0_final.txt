Philosophical Foundation:

All minimal units are equivalent, reflecting the integrated equivalence of 
information-energy-entropy-phase-coherence-uncertainty.

This concept interprets the smallest unit as a set through a relative and 
dynamic feedback network, transcending absolute causality.

Component Definitions:

smallest CEM (Comprehensive Evolution Mechanism) = 
    (adaptation) - (evolution) - (transformation) - (inheritance) - 
    (cascading-extension) - (hubble-expansion)

Note: CEM is counted as one element (18th position), with 6 internal mechanisms.
      hubble-expansion in CEM refers to the same concept as 
      "smallest hubble expansion" (29th position).

EQI (Entangled Quantum Information)

Mathematical Unity:

Dimensionless Symmetry Ratio: 35/35 = 1.0 (Perfect Unity!)

33. |eigenfrequency/eigenperiod| = |1/(2π)| ≈ 0.159155
34. eigenfrequency × eigenperiod = 2π ≈ 6.283185 (dimensional)
                                 ≡ 1 (normalized, dimensionless)
35. c (unity element) = 1 (perfect unity)

Relationship: (33) × (34) ÷ 2π = (1/(2π)) × 2π = 1 = (35) ✓

All paths converge to Unity = 1.
